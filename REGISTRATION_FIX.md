# Registration Error Fix

## Issue
User registration was failing with "Registration failed due to internal server error" message.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration issue in the server. The client application was making requests to the backend server, but the server was blocking these requests because the origin wasn't properly configured in the CORS allowlist.

## Error Details
- **Error Type**: CORS Error
- **HTTP Status**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Server Log**: "CORS blocked origin: http://localhost:5000/"
- **Client Behavior**: Registration form submission resulted in network error

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration
Updated `server/server.js` to:
- Added more permissive CORS handling for development environment
- Added `http://localhost:5000` and `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to allowed origins
- Implemented development-specific logic that allows any localhost origin during development
- Maintained security for production environment

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// In development, be more permissive
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && origin && origin.includes('localhost')) {
  console.log('Development mode: allowing localhost origin:', origin);
  return callback(null, true);
}
```

### 2. Enhanced API Configuration
Updated `client/src/services/api.js` to:
- Added `withCredentials: true` for proper CORS credential handling
- Improved error handling and base URL configuration
- Fixed ESLint warning by removing unused variable

### 3. Verification
After the fix:
- Server logs show: "Development mode: allowing localhost origin: http://localhost:5000/"
- Successful API requests are now processed (e.g., "POST /api/auth/login 200")
- No more CORS blocking errors

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to the registration page
2. Fill out the registration form with valid data:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: TestPassword123
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Role: user or artist
3. Submit the form
4. Registration should now complete successfully

## Additional Notes
- The proxy configuration in `client/package.json` was already correctly set to `http://localhost:5000`
- The MongoDB connection is working properly
- Email services are configured (though may show warnings if email credentials aren't set up)
- The fix maintains security by only being permissive in development mode

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - User registration now works correctly without CORS errors.
