## 1. Problem Statement

The traditional art marketplace faces several challenges in the digital age:

- **Limited Reach**: Artists struggle to showcase their work to a global audience beyond local galleries
- **High Commission Fees**: Traditional galleries charge substantial commissions (30-60%) reducing artist profits
- **Lack of Direct Communication**: No direct channel between artists and potential buyers
- **Authentication Issues**: Difficulty in verifying artwork authenticity and artist credentials
- **Payment Processing**: Complex and delayed payment systems
- **Portfolio Management**: Limited digital portfolio capabilities for artists
- **Market Accessibility**: High barriers to entry for emerging artists

**Need**: Develop a comprehensive digital marketplace that connects artists directly with buyers, providing secure transactions, artist verification, portfolio management, and enhanced user experience through modern web technologies.
