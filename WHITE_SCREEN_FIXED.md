# ðŸŽ‰ White Screen Issue Fixed!

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### âœ… **Issue 1: Incorrect Theme Function Call**
**Problem**: `isDark()` was being called as a function, but in the ThemeContext it's already evaluated.
**Fix**: Changed `isDark()` to `isDark` in App.js

### âœ… **Issue 2: Missing Layout Component** 
**Problem**: Pages were rendering without navigation or layout structure, causing content to appear invisible or malformed.
**Fix**: Wrapped all routes in the `<Layout>` component which includes:
- Navigation bar
- Footer
- Proper container structure

### âœ… **Issue 3: Port Conflicts**
**Problem**: Multiple Node.js processes competing for port 5000
**Fix**: Killed all conflicting processes and restarted cleanly

## Current Status:

âœ… **Frontend**: Compiling successfully  
âœ… **Backend**: Running on port 5000  
âœ… **Database**: MongoDB connected  
âœ… **Theme System**: Working properly  
âœ… **Layout**: Navigation and structure in place
